# Financial-Statements-by-Using-Excel
I would encourage you to check this nicely created example of simple transactions, to showcase my ability to create financial statements by using MS Excel. Here we can understand the financial situation and core business status, as well as track KPIS (such as cash inflow or outflow, net profit or loss, investment, etc). 

Prepared the Balance Sheet, Income Statement, and Statement of Cash Flow by using the direct & indirect method.
In this Excel sheet, you will find all the journal entries, general ledger, and trial balance to check the accuracy of the financial statements.

Thank you so much for your time.
